					<p>The University of North Georgia Computer Science Club was established in 2018 to bring together students majoring in CS, and those interested in the field with various skill levels. We provide a fun and safe enviroment to code and share knowledge. Our Meetings are located in the student center second floor, and they are every Tuesday and Thursday 1:30 to 2:15. A computer is not required, as there is a lab on the second floor in the locations of meetings. For more information, contact one of the officials through social media with the links below.</p>
